        <h2 class="h2-responsive">Our Commitment to your Privacy</h2>
        <h5 class="h5-responsive"><b>Introduction</b></h5>
        <p> I. Registry on Wye is committed to providing our clients with excellent service. Doing Business with a Service Provider involves providing information about yourself.</p>
       <p>ii. Registry on Wye is dedicated to maintaining high standards of confidentiality with respect to information entrusted to us, including that received via this Web Site. This Notice has been prepared to inform you of Registry on Wye practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of information about identified individuals, organizations or individuals whose identity may be inferred or determined from the information ("Personal Information") provided to Registry on Wye via the use of this public Web Site only.</p> 
        
       <br> 
       <h5 class="h5-responsive"><b>Collection of information</b></h5>
       <p>iii. Some information provided to us by clients, customers, contractors and other third parties might be considered private or personal. Without these details, we would not be able to carry on our business and provide our services to you. We will only collect such personal information if it is necessary for one of our functions or activities.</p>
        
       <p>iv. In particular, personal information is collected from people in the following situations;</p>
       <p>If you contact Registry on Wye, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</p> 
       <p>When you submit your e-mail address to our web site mailing list.</p>
       <p>When you submit your personal information to allow us to provide the service to you</p>
       <p>v. At or before the time the personal information is collected by us we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are made aware of who we are, the fact that you are able to gain access to the information held about you, the purpose of the collection, the types of organizations to which we usually disclose the information collected about you, any laws requiring the collection of the information and the main consequences for you if all or part of the information is not collected.</p>
       <br> 
       <h5 class="h5-responsive"><b>Use of information collected and disclosure of personal information to others</b></h5>
        
        <p>vi... We may use or disclose personal information held about an individual for the primary purpose for which it is collected (e.g. provision of our services, including administration of our services, notification to you about changes to our services, record-keeping following termination of our services to you and technical maintenance). We may also use such information for a purpose related to the primary purpose of collection and where it would reasonably be expected by you that we would use the information in such a way. This information is only disclosed to persons outside our business in the circumstances set out in this policy or as otherwise notified to you at the time of collection of the information.</p>
        
        <p>vii. In addition we are permitted to use or disclose personal information held about you:</p> 
        <p>Where you have consented to the use or disclosure;</p> 
        <p>Where we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious, immediate threat to someone's health or safety or the public's health or safety;</p> 
        <p>Where we reasonably suspect that unlawful activity has been, is being or may be engaged in and the use or disclosure is a necessary part of our investigation or in reporting the matter to the relevant authorities;</p> 
        <p>Where such use or disclosure is required under or authorised by law (for example, to comply with a subpoena, a warrant or other order of a court or legal process);</p> 
        <p>Where we reasonably believe that the use or disclosure is reasonably necessary for prevention, investigation, prosecution and punishment of crimes or wrongdoings or the preparation for, conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal or the implementation of the orders of a court or tribunal by or on behalf of an enforcement body.</p> 
        <br>

        <p>xii. Information stored within our computer systems can only be accessed by those entrusted with authority and computer network password sanctions.</p>
        
        <p>xiii. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 per cent secure.
